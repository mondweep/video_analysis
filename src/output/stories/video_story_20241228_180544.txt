**Story:**

In a bustling city, a colorful crowd gathered on a busy street. People hurried by, their handbags and backpacks swaying. Cars, motorcycles, and bicycles zipped through the traffic, while a horse-drawn carriage clopped along. A kite danced in the sky, its tail fluttering in the breeze.

**Poem:**

People, cars, and bikes galore,
A city scene with so much more.
Kites fly high, horses trot,
A bustling street, a vibrant spot.
